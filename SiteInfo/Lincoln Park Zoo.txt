Here at Lincoln Park Zoo we believe in data-informed decision making and putting animal welfare first. After evaluating several of our programs over the last few years with the help of the Animal Welfare Science Program, Animal Care, and Learning departments, the zoo is making “animal-first” changes to programming that involves ambassador animals.

“Animal-first” is an approach where various factors are considered: Does the animal have choice? Does the animal have control? Can the animal remain the comfort of its habitat? Is the program to the animals’ benefit? If the answer is ‘yes’ to all of these questions, that is an animal-first program. Moving forward, the zoo has committed to this approach for all ambassador animal programs and will be phasing out any program that does not meet these criteria.
