Seattle’s “must see” is now a “must do” following the Space Needle’s multimillion-dollar renovation. Glide onto The Loupe, the world’s first and only rotating glass floor, for never-before-seen views of the structure and the city. Lean into tilting glass walls on the open-air deck and float over Seattle on one of 24 angled Skyriser glass benches. Sip and sample the Pacific Northwest’s best while savoring the thrilling views. The future. Now open.
