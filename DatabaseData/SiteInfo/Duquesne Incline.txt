At one point in time Pittsburgh was home to nearly twenty active funiculars, or inclines as they are called here, which were used to transport people and cargo up and down the many different hills located around the city. Sadly, most of the Pittsburgh incline funiculars have closed over time, the city is now home to only two: the Monongahela Incline, located at Station Square, and the Duquesne Incline, located a mile down Carson Street. Although we thoroughly enjoy riding both of these funiculars, for those who are interested in enjoying the best view the city has to offer, taking a ride on the Duquesne Incline is a must do experience.

As one of only two remaining inclines in the city of Pittsburgh, the Duquesne Incline is near and dear to everyone's hearts (much like its sister, the Monongahela Incline, located further down Grandview near Station Square). Opened in 1877, the Duquesne Incline has had a long history that included being used as cargo transport, used as worker transport before roads were built, and surviving a brief closure in the 1960s that resulted in the community raising funds to ensure the historic funicular would be operated for many years to come.
