Start your day with an architecture boat tour on Chicago’s First Lady cruises. It’s a great way to see the city by water and is hosted by the Chicago Architecture Foundation. You’ll learn about some of Chicago’s most iconic buildings and find out how the city went from a small settlement in the 1800s to one of the largest cities in the world.
