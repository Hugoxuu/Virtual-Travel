One of the worst-kept secrets in Las Vegas: a one-day car rental usually costs less than a 10-minute taxi ride from McCarran Airport to the Strip. To get the best value on your on-and-off-Strip adventure, rent a car from the airport to use off-Strip, and use a taxi, Uber, or Lyft while cocktailing. Keep in mind that while self- and valet-parking at Strip casinos has historically been free, MGM-owned resorts recently instituted parking charges of up to $18.
