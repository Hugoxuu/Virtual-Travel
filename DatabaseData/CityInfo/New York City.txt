Good morning New York! We have started with you getting settled into your hotel and beginning your day with breakfast in Hell’s Kitchen/Midtown. A couple of our favorite spots for breakfast are listed below. Fill up on a good meal and grab some coffee for your event packed day! Your first excursion will be The Big Bus Hop On Hop Off tour. You will want to walk to 712 7th Ave (in between 47th & 48th St.). where you will catch the Downtown bus! This bus tour will welcome you to the city of dreams with beautiful views and it’s a great way to become accommodated with your surroundings. The Downtown loop will you take you through Times Square, by the Empire State building, continue down through the Flatiron District, Greenwich Village, Soho/Little Italy, making it down through Battery park, and then you will head back up with west side past The High Line ending at Madison Square Garden.
