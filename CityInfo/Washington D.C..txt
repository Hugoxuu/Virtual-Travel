Head to U Street for breakfast at a DC institution, Ben's Chili Bowl. Or, if you're visiting on a weekend, visit the colorful farmers' markets at Dupont Circle or Eastern Market on Capitol Hill. The blueberry buckwheat pancakes at Eastern Market are a local favorite. After breakfast, tour the Capitol Hill neighborhood and explore the U.S. Capitol, Library of Congress and Supreme Court. The neighborhood is also home to the Folger Shakespeare Library, which houses the largest collection of Shakespeare memorabilia outside of England. For lunch, take the Metro to Chinatown, where you'll find an array of options on 7th Street, near the Verizon Center. Or feast on fresh noodles and flavorful soups in Chinatown. And don't forget to snap a photo of the ornate Friendship Arch that looms over H Street.
