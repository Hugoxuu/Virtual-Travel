If Hollywood is the essence of all that is Los Angeles, then Venice Beach is the antithesis to all of that glitz and glamour. The vibe here is bohemian, quirky and artistic, and you’ll find street performers and vendors as well as athletes, skateboarders, tourists, and beachgoers. You might feel as though you need to be on the go all the time if you’re only in LA for 3 days but spend some time soaking up the sunshine and the atmosphere, checking out the gym where Arnold Schwarzenegger once worked out, and make sure you photograph the infamous hanging Venice sign.
