Start your Seattle vacation with an incredible breakfast: Portage Bay has four locations that serve hefty portions and take reservations. The restaurant serves classic fare such as Dungeness crab cake and smoked salmon eggs benedict. To work off the food coma, amble along historic Market Street afterward and peek into shops like Secret Garden Books, Ketch, and Horseshoe Boutique.
