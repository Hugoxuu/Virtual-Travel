Get the lay of the land from 400 feet above ground at the Coca-Cola Orlando Eye, which opened in 2015. On a clear day, you can see as far as Cape Canaveral. After, wander around the entertainment district at the base of the wheel, known as I-Drive 360. There's a lot to do here, including stops at Madame Tussaud’s wax museum, the Sea Life Aquarium, or the Skeletons Museum. If you're hungry, grab a bite at Shake Shack or Tin Roof (which has live music).
